# Waste Power
## A Circular Economy Platform

The goal of [this platform](http://wastepower.azurewebsites.net/) is to enable and facilitate contact between industries so that the waste from one can be used as raw materials in another.

Here you can create posts with information on what materials you want to be disposed of or which materials you are interested in getting.

Then any user is able to search and filter by what they are interested in and make contact with the corresponding companies.


> **Note:** Along with the platform we also built and deployed an API with FastAPI which is deployed [here](https://z5kmfo.deta.dev/docs).
